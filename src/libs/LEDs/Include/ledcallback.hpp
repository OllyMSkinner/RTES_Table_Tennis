    /// @brief This header declares a simple LED controller base class. This is to control the LED associated with the IMU swing position.

    /// @brief SOLID principles:
    /// @brief   S -   This class is responsible only for wrapping the basic GPIO-backed LED
    /// @brief         control mechanism and exposing a small interface for derived LED classes.
    /// @brief   O -   Derived classes can extend behaviour such as flashing or timed service
    /// @brief         updates without changing the base class interface.
    /// @brief   L -   Client code can use this base class interface and substitute any derived
    /// @brief         LED controller that implements the same contract.
    /// @brief   I/D - Other parts of the system can depend on this small LED abstraction rather
    /// @brief         than on a larger concrete GPIO implementation.
