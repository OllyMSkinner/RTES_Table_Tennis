/**
  *  This header declares the position detector class.
  *  It stores the configuration for detecting an upright position,
  *  processes sensor samples, tracks stability, and uses a callback
  *  when the required position has been confirmed. 
  *
  *
  *  SOLID :
  *    S - This class is responsible for analysing incoming motion/orientation
  *        samples and deciding whether the required upright position has been
  *        stably detected.
  *    O - Client code can extend what happens after detection by attaching a
  *       callback, without modifying the detector logic itself.
  *    L - The virtual destructor and virtual onSample() allow derived detector
  *        types to replace the base class safely, provided they preserve the same
  *        detection contract.
  *    I - The public API is intentionally small, exposing only the operations
  *        needed by client code: process samples, register a callback, and reset
  *        state. */
