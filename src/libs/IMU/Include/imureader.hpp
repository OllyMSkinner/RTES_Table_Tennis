/** IMUReader provides a threaded, event-driven wrapper around the low-level
* ICM-20948 driver.
*
* SOLID principles:
*   S - This class is responsible for coordinating asynchronous IMU sample
*       acquisition from the data-ready GPIO and forwarding decoded samples to
*       client code.
*   O - New behaviours can be attached through the callback interface without
*       changing the reader logic itself.
*   D - The low-level register and I2C interaction remain inside the IMU driver,
*       while this class focuses on threading and sample dispatch.
*
* Threaded IMU reader driven by the data-ready GPIO.*/
