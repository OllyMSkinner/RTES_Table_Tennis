## Driver Circuit

The motor is driven by an NPN transistor switch controlled by the
Raspberry Pi GPIO 18 software PWM output:

- A **220Ω resistor** on the transistor base limits the base current
  from GPIO 18.
- The **flyback diodes** across the motor terminals suppress the
  back-EMF spike when the motor is switched off.
- Power is supplied by a **4× AA battery pack (~5V)** separate from
  the Raspberry Pi supply to avoid voltage dips on the Pi rail.
