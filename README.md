# Haptic Ping

Haptic Ping combines table tennis shadow practice with haptic feedback to simulate a training experience that more closely resembles real play. Shadow practice is a widely used technique where table tennis players practice their strokes and form, but in the absence of a coach it can be difficult for players to know whether their position and movements are correct.

Our prototype addresses this limitation by providing real-time haptic feedback, allowing players to practice effectively without the need for a coach or any additional table tennis equipment.

Haptic Ping integrates an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a piezo sensor mounted on the bat to monitor both orientation and physical interaction. The piezo sensor detects correct grip and handling, which triggers an LED to confirm proper finger placement. Once the correct starting position is established, a second LED illuminates to indicate the system is ready for swing analysis. The IMU then tracks the bat's motion to analyse swing patterns in real time. When a correct swing is detected, the system provides immediate haptic feedback through an eccentric rotating motor (ERM).

## Wiring Diagram

## Hardware Assembly

- The IMU was mounted at the distal end of the bat using velcro (see below).
- The matrix board shown in the Wiring Diagram was affixed to one face of the bat using velcro.
- The piezolelectric sensor was attached to the bat at the area that ensures appropriate index finger placement for the user and therefore grip.
- Extended wiring (~1 metre for ease of use) was created by splicing female-to-female jumper cables with standard wire via soldering. Heat-shrink tubing was applied over each joint for insulation and mechanical reinforcement.
- The LED outputs were soldered to matrix boards with wire lengths tailored to suit the user’s preferred placement and positioned on a secondary station in front of the user to ensure clear visibility.
- The battery holder wire lenght was also extended to ~1 metre for ease of use.

## How It Works

The system uses a gate logic sequence to ensure feedback is only triggered for a valid swing:

1. **Grip detection** — The piezo sensor on the bat is sampled at 128 Hz by the ADS1115 ADC. An EMA filter smooths the signal and a threshold of 0.95V triggers a press event, illuminating the piezo LED.
2. **Position confirmation** — The IMU data-ready interrupt (GPIO 27) wakes the reader thread for each sample. The position detector checks the acceleration vector against a reference orientation using a dot product. After 10 consecutive samples that meet the predetermined threshold for correct starting position, the system is considered to be in the correct starting position and the IMU LED illuminates.
3. **Swing analysis** — Once both grip and position are confirmed, the swing processor categorises the swing vibration magnitude through the magnitude of the IMU acceleration. Gravity bias is removed via a rolling calibration window. The net linear acceleration magnitude is classified into duty cycle levels:
   - `>= 25 m/s²` → Highest Duty Cycle (long vibration burst)
   - `>= 15 m/s²` → Medium Duty Cycle (double burst)
   - `>= 10 m/s²` → Low Duty Cycle (short burst)
4. **Haptic feedback** — The ERM motor is driven by software PWM on GPIO 18 ramping up to max 80% duty cycle. The feedback pattern plays and the system resets for the next swing.

## Realtime Design

The code is entirely event-driven with no polling loops:

- **IMU sampling** — driven by the data-ready GPIO interrupt via `epoll` + `eventfd`. The reader thread blocks on `epoll_wait` and wakes only when new data is available.
- **ADS1115 sampling** — driven by the ALERT/RDY GPIO edge event via `libgpiodcxx`. The worker thread blocks on `wait_edge_events`.
- **PWM generation** — runs in a dedicated thread using `timerfd` for precise on/off timing at 30 Hz. No `usleep` or busy-wait.
- **Haptic patterns** — played in a detached worker thread using `timerfd`-based waits for each ramp step.
- **Shutdown** — handled via `signalfd` blocking on `SIGINT`/`SIGHUP` rather than signal handlers.

## Maximum Latency
### IMU - ICM20948
The sampling frequency is calculated by 
- **Accelerometer**: 1.125 kHz/(1+ sample_rate_div)
- **Gyrometer**: 1.1kHz/(1+ sample_rate_div)
The maximum frequency for accelerometer is therefore 1.125 kHz and gyrometer is 1.1kHz. The maximum latency found for the accelerometer and gyrometer to work is at 18.75 Hz (sample_rate_div = 59).

### Piezo - ADS1115
The available sample rate are 8Hz, 16Hz, 32Hz, 64Hz, 128Hz, 250Hz, 475Hz, and 860Hz. The maximum latency for the ADS1115 is at 860 Hz.

This can be adjusted in the main.cpp.

## Prerequisites

Haptic Ping runs on Linux (Raspberry Pi OS) and is not compatible with Windows.  
Prior to installing the required libraries, the system package list should be updated using:  
```bash
sudo apt update
```

### Enable I2C
```bash
sudo raspi-config
# Navigate to: Interface Options → I2C → Enable
```

### Install dependencies
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y libgpiod-dev libgpiod2 libi2c-dev i2c-tools libyaml-cpp-dev cmake build-essential
```

---

## Libraries

### libgpiod
- [libgpiod](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libgpiod/libgpiod.git/)
Used for all GPIO control on the Raspberry Pi via the Linux character device interface. In this project it is used in three places: the IMU reader configures the data-ready line (GPIO 27) as a rising-edge input and uses `epoll` on the GPIO file descriptor to wake the reader thread; the ADS1115 driver configures the ALERT/RDY line (GPIO 26) as a rising-edge input and blocks on `wait_edge_events`; and the LED controllers and PWM driver configure output lines to drive the LEDs and ERM motor.

### PWM
This library was developed by the project group.  
RPI_PWM is a software PWM library for the Raspberry Pi that drives GPIO 18 at 30 Hz using a dedicated worker thread and timerfd-based waits. It exposes a simple setDutyCycle() interface, clamps output to a maximum of 80% to reduce back-EMF spikes, and cleanly acquires and releases the GPIO line through libgpiod. 

### yaml-cpp
- [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp)
Used by the ICM-20948 driver settings class to load sensor configuration parameters — accelerometer scale, gyroscope scale, sample rate divider, and digital low-pass filter settings — from a YAML file. This allows sensor tuning without recompiling.

## Compilation from Source

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd RTES_Table_Tennis

# Build main application
cmake -S src -B build
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

---

## Usage

```bash
sudo ./build/rtes_main
```

The system will:
1. Wait for correct grip detected by piezo sensor → **Piezo LED on**
2. Wait for correct bat starting position detected by IMU → **IMU LED on**
3. Analyse swing in real time
4. Vibrate ERM motor on correct swing detection

Press `Ctrl+C` or `SIGHUP` to stop cleanly.
